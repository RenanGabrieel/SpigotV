# P.S.

This project is unrelated to this [shitfest](https://builtbybit.com/threads/spigotv-1-7x-1-8-x-minehq-kb-nspigot-kb-hit-detection-optimized-tick-stack-bukkit-api-chan.454234/)!
SpigotX source code was leaked and the majority of the work was done by them. If you sell SpigotX forks you need help.
